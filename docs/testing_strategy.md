# Khubzati API Testing Strategy

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Khubzati API. The primary goal is to ensure the API functions correctly, is reliable, secure, and provides accurate responses in both English and Arabic as per the requirements.

## 2. Scope of Testing

Testing will cover all implemented API endpoints, including:

*   Authentication (Registration, Login, Logout, Password Reset, Email Verification, Token Refresh)
*   User Profile and Addresses
*   Bakery Management (CRUD, Approval)
*   Restaurant Management (CRUD, Approval)
*   Product Management (CRUD)
*   Category Management (CRUD)
*   Cart Management
*   Order Management (Creation, Listing, Details, Status Updates, Cancellation)
*   Reviews Management
*   Notifications Management
*   Admin functionalities (User Management, Dashboard)

Key aspects to be tested for each endpoint:

*   **Functional Correctness:** Endpoints perform their intended operations accurately.
*   **Dual-Language Support:** Responses are correctly rendered in English and Arabic based on the `Accept-Language` header (e.g., `en`, `ar`, `en-US`, `ar-SA`). Default to English if the header is missing or unsupported.
*   **Data Validation:** Input validation for all request parameters and bodies.
*   **Error Handling:** Appropriate error codes and messages (in both languages) are returned for invalid requests, server errors, and business logic failures.
*   **Authorization and Authentication:** Role-based access control is correctly enforced for protected endpoints.
*   **Data Integrity:** Data is correctly stored, retrieved, and updated in the database.
*   **Edge Cases:** Testing with unusual or unexpected inputs.
*   **Idempotency:** For relevant endpoints (e.g., PUT, DELETE), ensure repeated requests have the expected outcome.

## 3. Testing Approach

Testing will be performed manually using `curl` commands executed via the shell. For each endpoint, test cases will be designed to cover:

*   **Positive Scenarios:** Valid inputs and expected successful outcomes.
*   **Negative Scenarios:** Invalid inputs, unauthorized access, and other error conditions.
*   **Language Scenarios:**
    *   Request with `Accept-Language: en`
    *   Request with `Accept-Language: ar`
    *   Request with no `Accept-Language` header (should default to English).
    *   Request with an unsupported language in `Accept-Language` (should default to English).

## 4. Test Environment

*   The API will be run locally in the sandbox environment.
*   A PostgreSQL database (or the configured Sequelize dialect) will be used, populated with necessary seed data or data created during testing.

## 5. Test Execution and Reporting

*   Test execution will involve running the API server (`npm start` or similar).
*   `curl` commands will be used to interact with the API endpoints.
*   Responses (headers and body) will be inspected to verify correctness.
*   The `todo_development.md` file will be updated to mark tested endpoints and note any issues found.
*   A summary of testing results, including any identified bugs or issues, will be provided.

## 6. Specific Areas of Focus

*   **Dual-Language Response Handler:** Thoroughly test the `responseHandler.js` utility and its integration into all controllers to ensure consistent bilingual responses.
*   **Middleware:** Test `authMiddleware.js` (`protect`, `authorize`) extensively for all roles and access scenarios.
*   **Database Interactions:** Verify that Sequelize models and associations are working correctly and that data is persisted as expected.
*   **Complex Workflows:** Test multi-step processes like order creation (cart to order, stock updates) and user registration with email verification (if fully implemented beyond placeholder).

## 7. Assumptions

*   The development environment is correctly set up with all dependencies installed.
*   The database schema is finalized and migrations (if any) are applied.
*   The `.env` file is configured with necessary environment variables (e.g., `JWT_SECRET`, database credentials).

## 8. Test Data Management

*   Initial test data (e.g., admin user, sample categories) may be seeded if necessary.
*   Data created during testing (e.g., new users, products, orders) will be used for subsequent tests.
*   The database might be reset periodically if tests become too dependent on a specific state.

This strategy will guide the testing efforts to ensure a high-quality API delivery.
